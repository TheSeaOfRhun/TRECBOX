Uses the 30-topic constructs.

NOTE: This setup used topics 1-150 as topics for the ziff
collections. Though the correct qrel files were found to have been
used, the assumption was qrels 1-150 were TREC 1, 2, 3 adhoc
qrels. Actually TREC 1, 2 & 3 adhoc qrels are 51-200 and 1-150 are the
routing qrels. Yes, there is an overlap. So 51-150 have two qrels, one
for adhoc and another for routing. Amidst all this confusion, it's
best this experiment be discarded.

NOTE
'.30' at the end of a qrel file name indicates that these qrels were
shortened by the 30-topic sets.


Errors in the first set of experiments done in January.

1. Qrels weren't shortened.
2. Used topics 1-150 as the TREC 123 topics.
3. There was confusion about the correct qrel being used for TREC 1,
   2, 3. Mixed up adhoc and routing.
4. What was labeled TREC 6, 7 and 8 separately, was actually a random
   sample from the 150 topics of TREC 6, 7, 8 together. Therefore, the
   qrels were not appropriate.
